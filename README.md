# Snake_Project_SFML
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.

Backbone is finished. Need to add menu with settings to change snake parameters such as speed, width, length, etc.

To run current version, navigate to Snake_Project_SFML\Snake\x64\Release\ and run SNAKE.exe application.
This should only work on windows machines. Must be compiled in other OS to run which will require SFML libraries to be linked to the project and requires SFML .dll files to run.
