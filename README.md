# Snake_Project_SFML
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.
My original plan was to create a simple snake game where the snake is made of square blocks.
I ended up creating a snake game where we could set the snake length and width to our liking which made it more complicated.  
GameState.cpp could definitely be more modular :).
I had a lot of fun creating this and will get back to it some time in the future.

Backbone is finished. Need to add menu with settings to change snake parameters such as speed, width, length, etc.

* #### Step one
  Install Visual Studio [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). I used the 2019 Community Edition.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBo5Cso-ufE) is a tutorial from youtube of how to install Visual Studio 2019.
