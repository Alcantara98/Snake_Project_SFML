# Snake_Project_SFML
## About
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.
My original plan was to create a simple snake game where the snake is made of square blocks.
I ended up creating a snake game where we could set the snake length and width to our liking which made it more complicated.
We could start with a snake where the width is longer than the length.
I had a lot of fun creating this and will get back to it some time in the future.
