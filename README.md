# Snake Game Project with SFML
## About
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.
My original plan was to create a simple snake game where the snake is made of square blocks.
I ended up creating a snake game where we could set the snake length and width to our liking which made it more complicated.  
GameState.cpp could definitely be more modular :).
I had a lot of fun creating this and will get back to it some time in the future.

## Technologies
- SFML v2.5.1
- C++
- Visual Studio 2019
## Setup SFML and Visual Studio
To run current version, navigate to Snake_Project_SFML\Snake\x64\Release\ and run SNAKE.exe application.
This should only work on windows machines. Must be compiled in the other OS to run.

* #### Step one
  Install Visual Studio [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). I used the 2019 Community Edition.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBo5Cso-ufE) is a tutorial from youtube of how to install Visual Studio 2019.
