# Snake_Project_SFML
## About
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.
My original plan was to create a simple snake game where the snake is made of square blocks.
I ended up creating a snake game where we could set the snake length and width to our liking which made it more complicated.
We could start with a snake where the width is longer than the length.
I had a lot of fun creating this and will get back to it some time in the future.

## Technologies
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community)
* SFML-2.5.1
##  Visual Studio & SFML Setup
* #### Step one
  Download Visual Studio [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). I used the 2019 Community Edition.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBo5Cso-ufE) is a tutorial from youtube of how to install Visual Studio 2019.
* #### Step two
  Download SFML-2.5.1 [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/). The years (2013, 2015, 2017) correspond to the versions of Visual Studio. I used SFML-2.5.1 2017 with Visual Studio 2019 and didn't have any issues. Once downloaded (you may need to unzip the file), I recommend placing the folder in 'C:/'.
