# Snake_Project_SFML
## About
Snake Project to learn SFML for creating C++ games.
My original plan was to create a simple snake game where the snake is made of square blocks.
I ended up creating a snake game where we could set the snake length and width to our liking which made it more complicated.
We could start with a snake where the width is longer than the length.
I had a lot of fun creating this and will get back to it some time in the future.

## Technologies
* Visual Studio 2019 (Community)
* SFML-2.5.1
##  Visual Studio & SFML Setup
* #### Step one
  Download Visual Studio [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). I used the 2019 Community Edition.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBo5Cso-ufE) is a tutorial from youtube of how to install Visual Studio 2019.
* #### Step two
  Download SFML-2.5.1 [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/). The years (2013, 2015, 2017) correspond to the versions of Visual Studio. I used SFML-2.5.1 2017 with Visual Studio 2019 and didn't have any issues. Once downloaded (you may need to unzip the file), I recommend placing the folder in 'C:/'.  
* #### Step three
  Download the repository from Github. Once downloaded, open Visual Studio 2019 and click 'Open a project or solution'. Navigate to the Snake directory (mine is at ..\GitHub\Snake_Project_SFML\Snake) and select 'SNAKE.sln'.
* #### Step four
  Now, we need to add the bins and libraries of SFML which are required for the project. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik) to set up SFML for windows visual. Now we should be able to build the project.
  
## Status
I have not touched this in a couple of months now. May add a main menu to and a users file to save best scores. To make it more difficult, we could add obstacles and create a maze-like environment.  If you want to check out the game, there is a release build in Snake_Project_SFML\Snake\x64\Release folder. Just run 'SNAKE.exe' to run the game. Should only work in windows 10 OSs.
